          This club is for Holistic development of youth. College education
          usually harps on the first two aspects, while association with an
          organization such as C-Cube helps in fulfilling the remaining one so
          show your support for the club by donating ! Your small contribution
          would count to a huge contribution and growth of the organisation and
          learning of individuals. This will also benefit the community which we
          serve and together we can bring smile on a lot of people's faces.
