            <p className="info">The main motto of this club is to train today's youths to become great leaders in the future Intellectual education influences the head and value-based education influences the heart. In fact, education that does not train the heart can be dangerous. If we want to build character in our offices, homes and society, we must have the wisdom to live a principle-centered life based on honesty, compassion, courage, responsibility etc.
                <br /><br />
                Educated people are those who can choose wisely and courageously under any circumstances between good and bad, between virtuousness and vulgarities regardless of the academic degrees they have. The goal of C-Cube is to rekindle the innate wisdom about meaning and purpose of life</p>
